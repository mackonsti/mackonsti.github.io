These repositories contains personal work and files, developed and maintained for a successful use with [Clover EFI bootloader](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/) and [OpenCore bootloader](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) on these specific hardware models.

There are **no** ready, pre-packaged EFI solutions provided; instead, the needed configuration and ACPI files are published for those interested in studying the code, while creating their own bootloader configurations.
